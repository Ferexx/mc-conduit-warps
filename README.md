# _Conduit Warps_
Conduit Warps allow players to warp between conduits using a menu GUI.

The cost of creating a new warp and of using the warps are configurable, with default value of 1,000,000 and 1,000 respectively.

To add a new warp, players must look at a conduit, then execute the following command:

```/addwarp <name> <item>```

Where `name` is the name of the warp, and `item` is the name of the item to display in the menu GUI (has autofill).

Once a conduit is registered as a warp, it can be deleted simply by breaking the block. No refund is issued.

Simply right-clicking on the conduit brings up the menu GUI allowing the player to teleport. Clicking on any of the teleport items will teleport the player to the associated location. The menu is paginated, so players can cycle through pages if many warps exist.
